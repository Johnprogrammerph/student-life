        <p>This is an article about the impact of social media use interventions on mental well-being. It discusses the
            growing concern about the negative effects of social media on mental health. It also details the different
            types of social media use interventions that have been developed. The article reviews 23 studies that
            investigated the effectiveness of these interventions. It found that therapy-based interventions were the
            most effective, with 83% of studies showing improvements in mental well-being. However, the overall quality
            of the studies was low, and more research is needed.</p>
