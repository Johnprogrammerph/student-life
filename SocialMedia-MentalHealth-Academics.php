    <div class="content">
        <p>The effect of social media on mental health (depression, anxiety, loneliness, eating disorders) and academic
            performance will
            be determined. Additionally, the differences between male and female responses will be compared. People who
            use social
            media will have a worse mental health (depression, anxiety, loneliness, eating disorders) and lower academic
            performance than
            people who don't use social media. The responses of males and females will differ. High school students at a
            variety of different
            school take a survey sent to them. The survey includes questions that allow for the data collected to show
            how social media
            affects the students. The independent variable is the age and gender of the respondents and the dependent
            variable is grades
            and mental health issues. The results show that the hypothesis is correct. The analysis shows that almost
            all of the factors that go
            into the effects of social media, are statistically significant. In conclusion, social media does affect
            mental health and academic
            performance in a negative way including distraction, sleep problems, self-consciousness, delayed homework or
            studying, and
            negative mood</p>
